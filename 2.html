<p>The human body is a complex system that consists of several interconnected systems and organs. Here are some key components of the human body:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Skeletal System</strong>: Provides structure, support, and protection to the body. It includes bones, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons.</li>
  <li><strong>Muscular System</strong>: Allows for movement and locomotion. Muscles work in tandem with the skeletal system.</li>
  <li><strong>Cardiovascular System</strong>: Responsible for circulating blood, oxygen, and nutrients throughout the body. It includes the heart, blood vessels, and blood.</li>
  <li><strong>Respiratory System</strong>: Facilitates breathing and exchange of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) between the body and the environment. It includes the lungs, trachea, and diaphragm.</li>
  <li><strong>Digestive System</strong>: Processes food, extracts nutrients, and eliminates waste. It includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas.</li>
  <li><strong>Nervous System</strong>: Coordinates and controls bodily functions. It includes the brain, spinal cord, and nerves.</li>
  <li><strong>Endocrine System</strong>: Regulates hormones and various metabolic processes. It includes glands such as the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands.</li>
  <li><strong>Immune System</strong>: Defends the body against pathogens and foreign invaders. It includes white blood cells, lymph nodes, and antibodies.</li>
</ul>
<p>These systems work together harmoniously to maintain homeostasis and ensure the body functions properly.</p>
