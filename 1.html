<p>The head is the upper part of the human body. It supports the face and is maintained by the skull, which encloses the brain. The head includes several key structures:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Skull</strong>: Protects the brain and supports the structures of the face.</li>
  <li><strong>Eyes</strong>: Organs of vision that allow us to see the world around us.</li>
  <li><strong>Ears</strong>: Organs of hearing and balance.</li>
  <li><strong>Nose</strong>: Organ of smell and a passageway for air into the respiratory system.</li>
  <li><strong>Mouth</strong>: Opening for food intake and speech production, containing teeth and tongue.</li>
  <li><strong>Brain</strong>: Control center of the body, responsible for thought, memory, emotion, and sensory processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each part of the head plays a critical role in the overall functioning of the human body.</p>
